## üé® Customization Guide

### 1. Personal Information
Update the following in each page module:

- **Home Page (`js/pages/home.js`)**:
  - Name in the hero section
  - Professional title and description
  - Profile image URL
  - Statistics (projects, experience, etc.)

- **About Page (`js/pages/about.js`)**:
  - Personal story and background
  - Experience timeline
  - Education details
  - Interests and values

- **Projects Page (`js/pages/projects.js`)**:
  - Project details in the `this.projects` array
  - Project images, descriptions, and technologies
  - GitHub and live demo URLs

- **Skills Page (`js/pages/skills.js`)**:
  - Skill levels and technologies in `this.skills` object
  - Certifications and achievements

- **Contact Page (`js/pages/contact.js`)**:
  - Contact information (email, phone, location)
  - Social media links
  - FAQ content

### 2. Styling and Colors
The website uses Tailwind CSS classes. To change colors:

- **Primary Color**: Replace `blue-600`, `blue-500`, etc. with your preferred color
- **Background Colors**: Modify gradient classes like `from-blue-50 to-indigo-100`
- **Custom Styles**: Add custom CSS in the `<head>` section of `index.html`

### 3. Images
Replace placeholder images with your actual content:

- Profile photos
- Project screenshots
- Professional headshots
- Company logos (if applicable)

### 4. Contact Form
The contact form includes basic validation and a simulated submission. To make it functional:

1. Replace the `submitForm()` method in `contact.js` with actual form handling
2. Integrate with a backend service or form handling service like:
   - Netlify Forms
   - Formspree
   - EmailJS
   - Your own backend API

## üì± Responsive Design

The website is built with a mobile-first approach and includes:

- **Mobile** (320px+): Single column layouts, hamburger menu
- **Tablet** (768px+): Two-column layouts, expanded navigation
- **Desktop** (1024px+): Multi-column layouts, full navigation
- **Large Desktop** (1280px+): Optimized spacing and larger content areas

## üîß Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

## üìà Performance Optimization

- **CDN Resources**: Fast loading of external libraries
- **Optimized Images**: Use WebP format when possible
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as they come into view
- **Minification**: Consider minifying JavaScript for production
- **Caching**: Implement browser caching for better performance

## üö¢ Deployment Options

### Static Hosting (Recommended)
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop deployment with form handling
- **Vercel**: Git-based deployment with automatic builds
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for public repositories
- **AWS S3**: Scalable static website hosting

### Traditional Hosting
- Upload files to any web hosting service
- Ensure the server can serve static files
- Point domain to the hosting location
